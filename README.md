# KinematicIntentionDecoding

Comparisons of real time inference of sEMG with different feature Sets via PID and Model Predictive Controller (MPC).

## Description

Real time closed loop PID/MPC for control of virtual hand via binary inference of sEMG by a deep neural network. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* MATLAB, any version that supports the Machine Learning and Statistics and Signal Processing toolboxes.

### Installing
